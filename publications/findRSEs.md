Find Research Software Engineers and Research Data Scientists

We look at various data sources in order to find individuals who do not  identify themselves as Research Software Engineers or Research Data Scientists.

The project Github is:
https://github.com/mawds/FindRSEs
With homepage: 
https://mawds.github.io/FindRSEs/

The pipeline is as follows. We looked into generating word clouds from Twitter, Indeed, and UKRSE job ads which could then be used to identify profiles on github or University websites. 

In one example we use Twitter biography data to see how RSEs describe themselves, and compare these terms to terms found in typical job adverts from the RSE association web site. The aim was then to use these descriptors to identify other similar individuals using Twitter's API.
